<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Introduction To Local And Internet File Management: Part 1</span></p>
<p class="p3"><img src="images/pict-001.jpeg" alt="images/pict-001.jpeg"></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"><b>Concept 1. </b></span><span class="s1">Web pages (html files) are made up of text and nothing else!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Although they sometimes look like large impressive documents, web pages actually are nothing more than text files. In addition to the text that you read when you view a web page, there is other, hidden, text that tells your web browser (Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox or whatever) how to display the page, where to find pictures, video, and other media files that may make up the webpage. The pictures and media files are totally separate from the web page itself and are stored in folders. This concept can feel a little strange at first but for you to become a competent web developer you must understand and come to terms with it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"><b>Concept 2. </b></span><span class="s1">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) control the structure and look of a modern website or web page. CSS was invented several years after people began to build websites but has become the de-facto standard for controlling things such as the color, width, and link styles of your site. One of the great things about CSS is that it makes it possible to change literally thousands of pages at once (if you happen to have that big of a website :-) just by altering a few letters in a CSS file. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"><b>Concept 3. </b></span><span class="s1">The web server is not your computer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As a student who is taking this course in the 21st century, you live in an era when most computers are always connected to the Internet. Being constantly connected tends to blur the distinction between a local and a remote computer, and you may not be clear about the distinction between files stored on your computer and files placed somewhere else on a web server.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Almost everything that you produce in this course should ultimately make its way to the Internet where it will be accessible through a website that you will create. </span><span class="s2"><b>It is important to understand that the webserver that shares your website with the world and the computer that you use to develop your website are not the same machine. </b></span><span class="s1">In this class you will develop web pages and ultimately websites on the computer in front of you. Once you have developed a web page or site that you are ready to share with the world, you will move the content to another computer known as a web server that, in this case, is physically located in Chicago.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Here is how it works.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span></p>
<ul>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">First, you create files and folders on the local computer that is inches away from you and link them together into a local "website" that ONLY exists on<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>YOUR computer. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Once everything works well on your local computer you use a type of program known as an FTP client to move the files and folders to another computer in Chicago that functions as a web server, that will make all of your work available to the wide wide world. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">When you move files and folders to the web YOU HAVE TO CREATE THE SAME FILE AND FOLDER STRUCTURE THAT EXISTS ON YOUR LOCAL COMPUTER OR IT WILL NOT WORK!</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Having everything on the web makes it convenient for me to assess your work and you end up with a portfolio that you can use to show your work to other people, including prospective employers. Lesson 1:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Reconstructing a Webpage</span><span class="s4"><img src="images/pict-002.jpeg" alt="images/pict-002.jpeg"></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Based on my experience, the way that students mess up most frequently in this class is by not understanding these core concepts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The purpose of this lesson is to help you get past this little barrier (which really is a little barrier) so that we can concentrate on things that are more fun and rewarding. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Download concept.zip from free.mynmi.net and decompress it. A new folder called concept should appear. Open concept and double click the file called fixme.html so that it opens in your browser (most likely it will open in Safari).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fixme.html used to display a lot of images but all have now been moved from their original folders and the original image folders have been thrown away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Your job is to fix the fixeme file by re-creating the folders that it is looking for and moving the correct images into them. Here’s how to do it.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">From the view menu of your web browser select “View Source" and find the line of code that says<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-003.jpeg" alt="images/pict-003.jpeg"></span><span class="s1">. This line of code tells the web browser to load a picture called climbing.jpg this is located inside of a folder called called pic1 .<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It also instructs the browser to display the picture with a width of 199 pixels, a height of 300 and a border of 2.<br>
</span><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-004.jpeg" alt="images/pict-004.jpeg"><img src="images/pict-005.jpeg" alt="images/pict-005.jpeg"></span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Look inside of the concept folder and find the climbing.jpg picture. See it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Create a new folder inside of concept called pic1 and drag climbing.jpg into it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Return to the browser window that displays fixme.html (not the window that displays the source code but the other one) Click the refresh button. At this point the climbing.jpg picture should appear.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Return to the browser window that displays the source code and each segment of code that looks for a picture. You should find a total of nine pictures and should also be able to tell that all of the pictures should be stored in </span><span class="s2"><b>two separate folders</b></span><span class="s1">, pic1 and pic2. Create the second folder, and place the appropriate pictures into whichever folder they belong to.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Once you have inserted all of the pictures return to the browser and hit refresh/reload. Do you see everything? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Next, locate the line of code that says: </span><span class="s5">&lt;link href="</span><span class="s6">css/style.css</span><span class="s5">" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;<br>
</span><span class="s1">This line of code tells the web browser to load a cascading stylesheet (css) called style.css from inside of a folder called css. The CSS file named style.css controls the structure of the webpage and the placement of the pictures.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Look inside of the concept folder and find style.css. Create a folder called CSS and drag style.css into the new folder. Now return to your browser (not the source code, the actual webpage) and refresh fixme.html. Hopefully you see<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>some changes. If not, double check the instructions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">As you read earlier, CSS files are very useful so let’s explore style.css by opening it in a text editor. Right-click on style.css and open it in textedit, unitron, or whatever seems to be available. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-006.jpeg" alt="images/pict-006.jpeg"></span><span class="s1">Take a look at the all_content tag at the top of the file. This tag, when applied, creates a very big div tag that is 1200 pixels wide, 1666 pixels high with a white background color as indicated by background-color: #FFF. Just for fun, let’s change that background from white to yellow by replacing the final F with a zero as in #FF0.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Save the file, return to your browser and reload fixme.html. The middle portion of the page should now be yellow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Take note as well, that all_content has a border setting of 4 pixels. Change that to 54, save the file, and reload fixme.html once again. See the big border?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Make all_content narrow by changing width: 800px; to something smaller.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Change it again and make it larger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finally, just for fun, change the body background color <br>
(as in </span><span class="s2"><b>body {<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>background-color: #000</b></span><span class="s1">;) <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to something else and check out the result.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although these are simplistic exercises, the message you should take away is that you can change any aspect of a webpage or website just by altering little pieces of text in an externally linked CSS file that is not actually part of the html document. Later on will learn LOTS more about CSS. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Download a picture from the Internet and put it into the webpage. <br>
</span><span class="s2"><b>hint1:</b></span><span class="s1"> get your picture into the webpage by renaming it and replacing an existing picture of the same name or <br>
</span><span class="s2"><b>hint2:</b></span><span class="s1"> by putting it into the same folder as another picture and modifying the code so that it loads into the page.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1"> Hang on to the concept folder and its contents (ie. don't throw it away), because we will use it again shortly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">An extremely simple introduction to Javascript and Jquery</span><span class="s4"><img src="images/pict-007.jpeg" alt="images/pict-007.jpeg"></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Javascript and its close relative Jquery are responsible for much of the fun (and serious) stuff that we see on the web. These tools often are used to turn a static webpage into something much more dynamic. Just like CSS, Javascript and Jquery often are contained in distinct files and have to be added to a webpage in order for it to function properly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Download slideshow.zip from free.mynmi.net. Once it’s unzipped take a look inside the slideshow folder. Pretty messy huh? Remind you of your closet (hopefully not :-)?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Similar to the last exercise, your job is to turn this mess into a fully functional slideshow by creating folders, naming them correctly, and placing the appropriate files into the folders. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To accomplish this goal, open index.html with your browser, view source, and look at the code. Check out lines 8-12 to get an idea of where to put the javascript files (the ones with a .js suffix) and the CSS file that controls the structure of the slideshow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By the way, on line 10, note that the code points to a javascript file named jquery.min.js that lives on the web on one of Google’s servers. You don’t have to worry about that one.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Once the .js and .css files are in place, turn your attention to the image files. You can easily figure out where they go by delving a little more deeply into the index.html document.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Now test your document by opening index.html in a browser. Have a slide show? See dogs? If not, keep trying.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Introduction to HTML, and CSS</span></p>
<p class="p3"><img src="images/pict-008.jpeg" alt="images/pict-008.jpeg"></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Web development can be extremely complex, but the underlying structure of all web pages is nothing more than raw unformatted text that is tied together with a formatting language known as </span><span class="s2"><b>html (HyperText Markup Language)</b></span><span class="s1">. The expression HyperText, comes from the idea that webpages contain hyperlinks that are used to move from one webpage to another. One way to conceive of html is to think of it as the skeleton of a webpage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"><b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</b></span><span class="s1"> is another key component of web development. While html provides the skeleton of a page, CSS is used to control the format. The various colors of a webpage, the position of images, the way that text reacts when you click, tap, or roll over it; all of these features are typically determined by css. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But enough talk about abstractions. Let's build a webpage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The only tool we are going to use is a basic text editor named unitron which you can easily find by searching for it. (please note: there are any number of text editors such as notepad (windows), TextWrangler (Mac), Sublime Text, etc. that will also do the job). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Open Unitron, create a new document and type: <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span><span class="s2"><b> &lt;html&gt; <span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;/html&gt;</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In HTML, anything enclosed in carrots or "brackets" are what we call "tags". These are the building blocks of HTML.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first building block of a webpage is the &lt;html&gt; tags that encase all other tags and all of the page’s content.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">But why tw</span><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-009.jpeg" alt="images/pict-009.jpeg"></span><span class="s1">o tags? In most cases, tags come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. Closing tags are always indicated by a / as in &lt;/html&gt;.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">In-between the two html tags (&lt;html&gt; and &lt;/html&gt;), type: </span><span class="s2"><b>&lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; and <br>
&lt;body&gt; <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/body&gt;</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Notice again that both these tags are pairs. The head and body are the two main parts of any html document. The "head" section never actually appears on a webpage, but contains settings and other important things that affect the webpage. The "body" section contains all of the actual content (words, pictures, css) that will go on the page.</span><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-010.jpeg" alt="images/pict-010.jpeg"></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">At this point, your code should now look like this:<br>
</span></p>
<ol class="ol2">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">At the very top of your document, just above the &lt;html&gt; tag, add </span><span class="s2"><b>&lt;!doctype html&gt;.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b></span><span class="s1">Although not strictly necessary, the &lt;</span><span class="s2"><b>!doctype html&gt; </b></span><span class="s1">is there to tell your browser that your page is written in the very latest version of html: html5.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Immediately after the &lt;html&gt; tag, add these tags &lt;title&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/title&gt;.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In between the tags, type your name, “my first webpage”, or something of the sort, as in &lt;title&gt;my first webpage<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/title&gt;.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The title tags define the text that appears at the very top of your browser’s window.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Save the file as index.html, and open it with your web browser (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, etc.) Although it’s a blank webpage because there is no content, you should see your title. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-011.jpeg" alt="images/pict-011.jpeg"></span><span class="s1"> At this point, your code should look identical (except for the title) to the code shown at left. If things seem a little crowded for actually working, feel free to use your tab key or to hit return a few times to spread everything out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Something interesting about HTML is that whitespace in within code is completely ignored. It makes no difference if you place your tags one line apart or 20 lines apart. As long as they're in the order you want, the final page will look the same in the browser. Tabbing and spacing your tags can make your code easier to read and to work with.</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Time for content. To speed things up, paste the dummy text shown below into the BODY section (between the two body tags).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aenean commodo ligula eget dolor. Aenean massa.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus. Donec quam felis, ultricies nec, pellentesque eu, pretium quis, sem. Nulla consequat massa quis enim."</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Save index.html and reload it with your browser. <br>
Hmm…all of the text is there, but the two paragraphs should run together in spite of having a space between them. Remember, all white space in code is ignored, so we have to tell the web browser what's what by marking up our content with tags.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Add a </span><span class="s2"><b>&lt;p&gt; </b></span><span class="s1">between the paragraphs, and a corresponding </span><span class="s2"><b>&lt;/p&gt;</b></span><span class="s1"> tag at the end of the last paragraph. Save your document and reload again. This time, the paragraphs should be separated by a line. The </span><span class="s2"><b>&lt;p&gt;</b></span><span class="s1"> tag is the PARAGRAPH tag, and specifically denotes paragraphs on a page.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Now it’s time for a very basic introduction to CSS. Create a new file and save it as style.css in the same location as your index.html file. Next, add this code immediately after the &lt;/title&gt; tag:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
&lt;link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"&gt;.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The purpose of this line of code is to attach the CSS file to your document. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-012.jpeg" alt="images/pict-012.jpeg"></span><span class="s1">The next step is to create a ‘style’ within your new CSS stylesheet that will affect your document.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Return to style.css and type in the code shown at right. (copying and pasting may cause an error).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">What’s a Div Tag?</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Div tags are are the principal tool that web developers have for formatting content. An easy to understand how div tags work is to think of them as boxes or rectangles full of text and pictures that can be moved around and placed in different locations on a web page. Div tags can be as big or small as you define them to be, can have different font and background colors than the rest of the page, borders,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and lots more. As you may already suspect, all of these characteristics are controlled via CSS. So, let’s make a CSS rule and apply it. </span><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-015.jpeg" alt="images/pict-015.jpeg"></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1"> Return to style.css and add a new class named .mydiv as shown at right.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Return to the html document and ‘wrap’ the div tag around the first sentence as shown below. </span><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-016.jpeg" alt="images/pict-016.jpeg"></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-017.jpeg" alt="images/pict-017.jpeg"></span><span class="s1">Save both the html and css files and preview the html file in your browser again. Things probably look a little different but you can’t really see the div tag. Let’s change that by adding a background color. Return to the css file and add </span><span class="s2"><b>background-color: #000; </b></span><span class="s1">to the .mydiv class, as shown at right. Save the css file and preview everything in the browser again. At this point you should be seeing UGA colors but why did the text disappear? Answer: black text; black background. Change the text to white by adding color: #FFF; to .mydiv, save the css file and check it again in the browser. See the text?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Now add the same div tag to the second sentence, the same way that you added it to the first sentence. When you save everything and preview yet again, the two div tags should be stacked on top of each other. Let’s make on more small change by adding </span><span class="s2"><b>float: left; </b></span><span class="s1">to the .mydiv class. Once again, save and preview. This time the div tags should appear right next to each other. In fact, they look like one div tag instead of two.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-018.jpeg" alt="images/pict-018.jpeg"></span><span class="s1">Let’s go for broke by adding a right margin to separate the div tags and a white border to give them some distinction. To do so, add the 4 lines of code shown at right to the .mydiv class. This time when you save and preview all of this in the browser, things should look quite vastly improved.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The next lesson introduces Dreamweaver, a powerful tool that, to some degree, makes it possible to build a website without understanding a bit of the underlying code. Although Dreamweaver is a great tool, like many powerful tools it hides a lot of complexity and does not always offer the options that you may want or need. That is why it is very important for you to keep in mind that web pages in reality are made of nothing but text. As you become a more advanced and ambitious web developer, you will frequently need to edit that text, known as source code, by hand, in order to accomplish all of your goals.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This workbook offers an introduction hand-coding, but there are lots of good, free resources that do teach hand-coding. <a href="http://w3schools.com"><span class="s7">w3schools.com</span></a> is one great site where you can learn more about html and CSS from the coders perspective. It will be time well spent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Introduction to Dreamweaver (and Dropbox)</span></p>
<p class="p3"><img src="images/pict-026.jpeg" alt="images/pict-026.jpeg"></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"><b>Dreamweaver</b></span><span class="s1">. When the WWW first arose back in the mid-nineties most people (including myself) produced content for the web by producing and editing what are called html-tags (html stands for hypertext markup language).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of the reasons that the www grew so quickly is that any text editor such as Windows notepad can be used for html editing and it really isn't that hard to produce a basic webpage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It wasn't long, however, before web designers began to produce pages with fancy formatting and to tie them together into huge complex websites that were challenging to maintain and update.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As web development became more complex, software tools were developed to make the job easier and these days there are lots of different tools for website development. The most popular, and probably the most expensive, of these tools is called Dreamweaver, which is the program that you are about to be introduced to. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"><b>Dropbox</b></span><span class="s1">, for those of you who aren’t familiar with it, is a great tool for backing up your work and for synchronizing content across multiple computers. It works especially well with Dreamweaver because the site that you create on your classroom computer will automatically be copied to any other computer that establish your Dropbox account on. You may already have an account. Otherwise, here’s how it works.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1"> If you haven't received an email from your instructor or one of your classmates that invites you to establish a Dropbox account, go directly to Dropbox.com to establish an account. </span><span class="s2"><b>Do not download the Dropbox program, your computer has it already.</b></span><span class="s1"> If another Dropbox user has invited you via email, however, be aware that if you accept their invitation (by clicking on a link in the email) they get more free space!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <ol class="ol2">
    <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1"> If you dropbox account is already full, you may want to consider another free cloud-based service such as copy.com. If you go with copy.com, click on <a href="https://copy.com?r=IRTdQf"><span class="s8">this link</span></a> to get and give (to me) extra space.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  </ol>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Set up your account online and then activate it on your classroom computer by starting the dropbox program (use finder to locate it). </span><span class="s2"><b>Once again, there is no need to download the Dropbox (or copy) application</b></span><span class="s1">! It is already installed on your computer.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s2"><b> Create a folder inside of the Dropbox folder and name it mysite</b></span><span class="s1">. The mysite folder is where you should store all of the work that you do for this class.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Set up Dropbox on your home computer. Voila! All of the content that you create inside of Dropbox on your classroom computer will be stored online and on your home computer. If you change anything inside of Dropbox at home, the changes will also appear on your classroom computer. </span><span class="s2"><b>Even better, Dropbox can compensate for human frailty. </b></span><span class="s1">Everything in your Dropbox folder is stored online with version control. This means that if, for example, you work on a paper for days and somehow screw up and save the paper after stupidly deleting 20 pages, Dropbox has your back. Just browse to the online version of the file, right-click and ask for the earlier version before your brain took a vacation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p10"><span class="s9"><b>Dreamweaver's Site Tool</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The first step in building a website with Dreamweaver is to decide where on the local computer to build and store it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this lesson you will create the location on your computer where you will store all of the work that you will later upload to the Internet. You will also be introduced to Dreamweaver's site tool and file panel. The purpose of both of these tools is to help you manage the folders and files that go into making a website. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-027.jpeg" alt="images/pict-027.jpeg"></span><span class="s1">If you haven't already, create a new folder inside of your Dropbox folder called mysite. Start Dreamweaver</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Use finder (command key +f ) or look inside of the applications folder in the Adobe Dreamweaver folder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Open Dreamweaver.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">The third to the last menu at top is named Site.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Click on Site and select New Site. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">A site definition box will pop up that prompts you to name your site and to define a local site folder as shown below. </span><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-028.jpeg" alt="images/pict-028.jpeg"></span><span class="s10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <ol class="ol2">
    <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s2"><b>Site Name:</b></span><span class="s1"> Name the site after yourself, your dog, your little sister, whatever makes sense to you.</span></li>
    <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s2"><b>Local Site Folder:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span><span class="s1"> Browse to the mysite folder inside of the Dropbox folder and select it. (this is important to get right, so ask for help if you need it).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
    <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s2"><b>Click Save:</b></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ignore the advanced settings and the other options that appear in the left side of the site definition box and click save.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Before we go any further there is one concept that I want you fully understand and remember forever. </span><span class="s2"><b>Everything you create or use with Dreamweaver should be stored in a site folder. </b></span><span class="s1">If you casually start editing and creating work in some random place such as your desktop that is not within a site folder, you will invariably screw up. Why? Because html development relies on links to lots of different files. When you work within a site folder Dreamweaver creates nice, simple </span><span class="s2"><b>RELATIVE </b></span><span class="s1">links such as </span><span class="s2"><b>images/mypicture.jpg</b></span><span class="s1"> as opposed to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span><span class="s2"><b>ABSOLUTE </b></span><span class="s1">links like:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span><span class="s2"><b>your_computer/Users/your_name/Desktop/mypicture.jpg</b></span><span class="s1">. Those absolute links work fine until you upload your work to the web server, at which point everything stops working! <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s11">You can create multiple site folders and easily switch between them but don’t forget: </span><span class="s1"><b>YOU HAVE TO PUT EVERYTHING IN A SITE FOLDER. If it’s part of a webpage, it must be in the site folder. Don’t forget this.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s9"><b>Explore the file browser</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Dreamweaver has many features that are designed to assist web developers. One of the most useful is the proprietary Dreamweaver file browser which helps you to organize files and folders without breaking the relationships between html files, pictures, and CSS files. Lets try it out.</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">The best way to understand Dreamweaver's file browser is to contrast it with your computer's built in file management system. Find the concept folder that you worked on in a previous lesson- most likely it is inside of your downloads folder - and copy or drag it into the mysite folder that you just created.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-029.jpeg" alt="images/pict-029.jpeg"></span><span class="s1">Open the fixme.html file in your browser. If you followed all of the instructions correctly in the previous lesson, you should see a webpage with several pictures in the middle of a grey background.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If not, you need to repeat Lesson 1: Re-constructing a webpage, before going any further.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Drag all of the pictures that are currently inside of the pic1 folder into the concept folder (ie. one level back) as shown at right. Drag style.css into the concept folder as well. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Reload the webpage. Everything should look pretty terrible because the browser can't find the CSS file and several of the pictures. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Fix the webpage by moving the pictures back into the pic1 folder and style.css back into the CSS folder. Refresh the browser again; everything looks good, right?<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Now you are ready to appreciate what is really cool about the Dreamweaver's file browser. Return to Dreamweaver and look at the file browser in the upper righthand corner. You should see the concept folder. If not, click the refresh button.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Open the content folder and double click on fixme.html to open it. Make sure that you are in Dreamweaver's split view </span><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-030.jpeg" alt="images/pict-030.jpeg"></span><span class="s1"> so that you see the source code on one side of the screen and the wysiwyg view on the other side. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Once again, move the pictures from the pic1 folder into the concept folder. </span><span class="s2"><b>Wait</b></span><span class="s1">! A popup appears asking something about updating links.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Click update and see what happens or rather what doesn't happen. The page looks the same even though you moved pictures out of their folder. That is because Dreamweaver automatically updated the code to reflect the fact that you moved files. Take a look at the code on the left side of the Dreamweaver window and see if you can spot the changes. Every time you move or change the name of a file or folder with Dreamweaver's file browser, Dreamweaver gives you the opportunity to update all html files that are affected by the change. This is a VERY VALUABLE TOOL.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Be sure and save fixeme.html in order to preserve the changes made by the file browser. <br>
</span><span class="s2"><b>So here's the rule: If you decide to reorganize your site, use Dreamweaver's file browser instead of your computer's file browser. Otherwise, you will break connections and completely screw up your site!<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p12"><span class="s2"><b><br>
</b></span><span class="s12">Create your homepage</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Time to play by starting your homepage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Create a new basic html file (File – New) and save it into the root level of your mysite folder as index.html. This file, index.html at the </span><span class="s2"><b>root</b></span><span class="s1"> level of your site will eventually be full of links to ALL of your future work in this class and you will also make it look a lot better than it will today. </span><span class="s2"><b><br>
READ THIS AND LEARN IT.</b></span><span class="s1"> You may create additional index.html files inside of folders that are deeper inside of your mysite folder but you can have only one index file for the whole site and that is the one at the </span><span class="s2"><b>root</b></span><span class="s1"> level. The reason we name the file index.html is because web servers are programmed to look for names like index.html or home.html. When you browse to a folder on a website, such as your_user_name.mynmi.net, the webserver sends the index.html file to your web browser automatically, instead of showing the contents of the folder. Get that???</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Go to the View menu and make sure that document toolbar is checked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Give your document a title (in the document toolbar where it currently says Untitled Document). Since you are creating your home page for this course you may want to name it after yourself. </span><span class="s2"><b>In the future provide a title for every web page you ever create.</b></span><span class="s1"> Otherwise, people may assume that you don't know what you are doing and not take your work seriously. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">You should be working in the split view. On the right is the “what you see is what you get” or “wysiwyg” view. At left you should see the html code that generates the look that you see on the right side. Both code wysiwyg view are helpful. Dreamweaver is designed to help you perform tasks that used to require a lot of tedious coding by generating the code for you when, for example, you add an image or link to a page. The code view is useful for the many things that can’t be done via the wysiwyg interface and there are LOTS of things that can only be done by getting into the code.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Click inside of the work area (wysiwyg or right side) and type your name. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-031.jpeg" alt="images/pict-031.jpeg"></span><span class="s1">Select the text that you typed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Using the property inspector (see right) change the font to Heading 1 as shown at right. We will learn about more advanced text formatting options later. Take a look at the code view of your page and find your name. It should be preceded by a tag that looks like this &lt;h1&gt; and followed by another, closing, &lt;/h1&gt; tag.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just for fun change the the 1 in both the &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt; tags to larger numbers and observe what happens on the right side in the wysiwyg view.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">In a previous lesson, you took a picture of yourself. Find that picture or take a new one now with photo booth, and drag it into your mysite folder. Once the picture is in the mysite folder open it with Adobe Fireworks and resize it so that it is no more than 400 </span><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-032.jpeg" alt="images/pict-032.jpeg"></span><span class="s1">pixels wide. </span><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-033.jpeg" alt="images/pict-033.jpeg"></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Now use your file browser (shown at right) to drag YOUR picture into the document. Once again, take note that the file browser is a great tool for organizing, editing and putting to work all of the different files that make up a website.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whenever you add files of any sort to a folder that is designated by Dreamweaver as part of a website, the file browser finds them and makes them easily accessible for use. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Type a couple of sentences about yourself and copy and paste them a few times so that you have lots of text on the page. Drag the picture around on the page, placing it in the middle of the text.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All it does is push the text down which is kind of disappointing. Let's improve things a bit and make the text wrap. To accomplish that goal, it's time to start learning about an important feature of web development called CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS has evolved into the primary formatting tool for web developers and we will spend LOTS of time in subsequent lessons learning to use CSS effectively. For now, let's use CSS to format your picture.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">The first step is to create a CSS source. There are two ways to create and store CSS rules: inside of the html page itself or inside of an external file. CSS rules that become part of an html document, apply only to that one document. CSS rules that are stored in an external file can be shared among literally thousands of html files.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">For now, let’s take the easy way and define the css rule within our page. As shown at right, click the CSS Designer tab and select Define in Page. Now take a look at your source code. At approximately line 6, you should see two style tags: &lt;style type=“text/css”&gt;, followed by &lt;/style&gt;. All of the css that you create for this document will live within these style tags. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">From the Selectors tab, click on the + sign to create a new CSS rule. </span><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-034.jpeg" alt="images/pict-034.jpeg"></span><span class="s1">Name your CSS rule .mypicture<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(be sure and start the name with a period) and click OK.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You have just created a CSS class.<br>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1"> Click on .mypicture to select it. Just below the Selectors tab is the Properties tab which is designed to make it easy for you to add properties to your selectors simply by clicking. Scroll down until you locate the ‘float’ property and select left as shown at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>right.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Right-click one time on your picture to select it and, from the drop down menu, apply the mypicture class that you just created.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Click on the .mypicture rule again, play around with the alignment and margins, and click OK.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Keep playing until you are satisfied (or bored :-).<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Before going any further take a look inside of your document’s code and find the .mypicture rule which is located between in the head section somewhere between this </span><span class="s2"><b>&lt;head&gt; </b></span><span class="s1">tag that designates the beginning of the head and this tag </span><span class="s2"><b>&lt;/head&gt; </b></span><span class="s1">that ends it. You should be able to see all of the characteristics that you added to the .mypicture rule while working with the CSS panel. Change some of the margins just see what happens. As you can tell, CSS rules can be edited by hand or via Dreamweaver’s CSS panel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Next, let's use CSS to format text. Once again, click on the + sign to create a new CSS rule. (you may have to re-select your source).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Name your CSS rule as ".Bigtext" and click OK.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Now choose a font family (your choice), set the font size to 36px, pick a font color and click OK.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Select some text and right-click again (or use the Class selector on your property inspector) to apply the Bigtext CSS rule to the text. Did it get change? Good!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Create another CSS rule with different text characteristics and apply it to additional text so that you have two separate text blocks with distinct formatting. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Use these new-found tools to make your page beautiful (create as many new CSS rules as you like).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Once you are happy with the way that your page looks, save it (it should already be named index.html). Now preview the file by clicking on the globe on the document toolbar. </span><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-035.jpeg" alt="images/pict-035.jpeg"></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Congratulations, you have created your homepage and chances are it is quite ugly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No worries. You will make lots of changes to this page as the course progresses and its looks will improve.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">If your web account is already set up (it may not be) upload the index.html file and the picture of yourself to your web server. To do this, open Cyberduck and use the bookmark that you created in a previous lesson to login. You may have to re-enter your password but everything else should happen automatically.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-036.jpeg" alt="images/pict-036.jpeg"></span><span class="s1">Once you are connected, you should see a screen that looks like the one at right. public_html is the folder that will hold your website for this class.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>public.html is web active and anything you put in there is open to the world so use discretion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1"> Drag the index.html file and the picture of you into the folder with your username and then check it out with your web browser.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The url will be something like ealdridge.mynmi.net. Hopefully, everything works properly and looks the same as it did when you viewed the version of index.html that is on your computer. If not, try again or check with your instruction.</span><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-037.jpeg" alt="images/pict-037.jpeg"></span></li>

<p class="p13"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Intra-document links and image maps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Naming the class.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><img src="images/pict-038.jpeg" alt="images/pict-038.jpeg"></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s1">This lesson introduces two basic tools- internal links and image maps- that have the attractive characteristic of being both useful and very easy to learn. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<ol class="ol3">
  <li class="li12"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s13"><b>Internal Links</b></span><span class="s1">: As you know, web pages are full of links. Most times those links take you to external documents that may take a few seconds to load into your browser, but you can also create internal links within documents that take no time at all to load.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To make internal links you first must insert a marker (called a named anchor) inside of your document so that you have something to link to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Internal links are easy to implement but can be challenging to implement without confusing your users. <br>
<br>
The biggest issue is that when you link within a small document, it may not be clear to the user where the link has taken him or her because the information associated with another link is also visible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this case, for example, if the names of all class members are visible when you click a link, how can you know who you just clicked? But there is a solution, which you will see shortly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p12"><span class="s13"><b>B. Image Maps:</b></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Image maps are typically useful when you have a complex image, such as a group picture or a map, with features that you want to highlight by linking to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Enough Talk. For this exercise you need a picture with all members of your class (probably provided by your instructor; if you don't already have it, ask for it).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Place the picture inside of your mysite/images folder. (make the images folder if you don't have it) <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li12"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Create a new html file, name it wholeclass.html and save it into your </span><span class="s13"><b>mysite</b></span><span class="s1"> folder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li12"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Insert the class members picture into your document.</span></li>
  <li class="li12"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">From your code window, Insert the following code ( </span><span class="s13"><b>&lt;div style="height:1600px; width:400px" &gt;&lt;/div&gt;</b></span><span class="s1"> ) below the class picture image. What you are doing here is using inline CSS to add a really long, but invisible, div tag, so that names will not be visible until someone clicks a link. You will also add the same div tag between each class member's nam so that you see only one name when you click a link.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Click below the div and insert a section id as in: &lt;section id="classmate_name"&gt; (feel free to copy and paste).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Name the section id after one of your class members (make sure you have no spaces in this name as in john_smith instead of john smith.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Next to the section id type your class mates name as in &lt;section id="classmate_name"&gt;John Smith.</span></li>
  <li class="li12"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Now click on the classmembers picture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Use the Hotspot tool<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(bottom left of your property inspector )to draw a circle on someone's head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-039.jpeg" alt="images/pict-039.jpeg"></span><span class="s1">Type # next to the name you gave to the anchor in step 6 (as in #john_smith ) into the Link window.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li12"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Test your file.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If it worked, repeat the process with approximately 5 other class members.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span><span class="s13"><b> Be sure to add the long div tag between each person's name and section id.</b></span></li>
  <li class="li12"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Test it. Does it work? Keep trying till it does.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Naming the class the jquery way.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><img src="images/pict-040.jpeg" alt="images/pict-040.jpeg"></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s1">You will get a lot of exposure to jquery later on in this course. The intent of this lesson is to give you a taste of just how useful this powerful web development tool can be. In the previous lesson you created links, inserted tables, named anchors, etc., all for the purpose of displaying your classmates’ names. With jquery there is an easier and, in my view, much cooler way to accomplish the same goal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here’s how:</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li12"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Duplicate wholeclass.html and create an identical file named wholeclass2.html. You can duplicate via finder by right-clicking on wholeclass.html or via Dreamweaver by using ‘save as’.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li12"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Open wholeclass2.html and paste in <br>
</span><span class="s13"><b>&lt;script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; <br>
</b></span><span class="s1">just before the &lt;/head&gt; tag.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This step enables jquery by connecting your document to the latest online version of the jquery library. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li12"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Delete every one of those divs and section ids that you created. If you do it the easy way, via code view, this step should take only a few seconds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li12"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Below the class image and just after the &lt;/map&gt; tag, paste in <br>
</span><span class="s13"><b>&lt;div id="tellme"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;. </b></span><span class="s1">This step creates a div tag with an ID named ‘tellme’. What’s a div tag? Think of it as a box that you create in order for it to hold something. In this case, the tellme id is where your classmate's names will magically appear.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li12"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Find one of the hot spots that you created on top of your classmates’ faces and look at the code, which should read something like the following:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</span><span class="s2"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>&lt;area shape="circle" coords="415,18,11" href="#emuel_aldridge" /&gt;</b></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Take note of the portion that reads </span><span class="s2"><b>href="#emuel_aldridge" /&gt; </b></span><span class="s1">and replace it with the following code and the name of your classmate, as in:<br>
</span><span class="s13"><b>href="#" onmouseover= " $('#tellme').html('Emuel Aldridge'); " &gt;</b></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Test it in your browser. If everything works properly, the name of your classmate should appear below, inside of the tellme div tag.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Mouseover is great when your user has a mouse but what if your user is using a tablet or smartphone? To accommodate mouseless users, add the following ‘mousedown’ function immediately after the semicolon that ends the mouseover function as in:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</span><span class="s14">onmouseover=$('#tellme').html('Emuel Aldridge');<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span><span class="s15"><b> onmousedown=</b></span><span class="s14">$('#tellme').html('Emuel Aldridge');</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Now do the same for the rest of your classmates. This may seem a bit tedious but don't you want to know everyone?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>BTW, most of your classmate's pictures and names should be available in the <a href="http://mynmi.net/4110"><span class="s7">http://mynmi.net/4110</span></a> folder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Easy, right? Later on you will learn how to load videos, sounds, and even entire web pages into div tags with jquery. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cascading Stylesheets (CSS):<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lesson #1</span></p>
<p class="p3"><img src="images/pict-041.jpeg" alt="images/pict-041.jpeg"></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Cascading Stylesheets (otherwise known as css) offer a powerful formatting tool for web developers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of the best things about CSS is the ability to attach a web document to a pre-existing group of styles that can instantly offer advanced formatting options.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another nice capability is that once you have applied the same style to multiple places in a document, all you have to do to change the look of your document is change the style.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At that point, all instances of that style are automatically updated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Confusing?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let's go styling and find out. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p15"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Download <a href="http://free.mynmi.net/stylesheet_example.zip"><span class="s8">http://free.mynmi.net/stylesheet_example.zip</span></a> and unzip it (this may happen automatically).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Find the unzipped stylesheet_example folder (most likely in your downloads folder) and copy it into your mysite folder. At this point, the stylesheet_example folder and all of the files and folders within it are part of your Dreamweaver site.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Use Dreamweaver's open file browser to find example_page.html and open it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Find the CSS Designer tab, click the + sign and this time select Attach Existing CSS. Browse to the stylesheet_example folder, and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>attach the file named stylesheet.css.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before going any further look at your code and find the link that you just created to stylesheet.css that reads: </span><span class="s2"><b>&lt;link href="stylesheet.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;</b></span><span class="s1">. This information is important because it tells your html document where to find the stylesheet. In this case the stylesheet is in the same folder as the html document. Otherwise, you would also see a folder name in the path statement such as </span><span class="s2"><b>&lt;link href="css/stylesheet.css .</b></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Click the Selectors tab and take a look at the style names.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You are about to apply those styles. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>

  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1"> Drag the file named stylesheet.css out of the stylesheet_example folder to the desktop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now look at your example page.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All of those styles should disappear because the html file can no longer find the stylesheet.

  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1"> Before you leave, you MUST explore some of the CSS text effects such as text-shadow, text-transform that converts text to upper or lower case, letter spacing and word spacing.

Here’s how.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>

<p class="p3"><img src="images/pict-052.jpeg" alt="images/pict-052.jpeg"></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In the early days of web design the options for making a website look the way you wanted it to were limited. Most developers, including me, became very familiar with the table tool but there has always been a demand<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and need for more flexible options. Over time, CSS used in conjunction with div tags has become an increasingly common way to lay out websites. As a web developer you are going to encounter CSS and div tags a lot so you need to become familiar with how they work. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In this lesson you will create 3 separate web pages that showcase pictures from a trip to Costa Rica and learn a lot about using div tags in conjunction with CSS to position content.

<p class="p10"><span class="s9">Absolute Positioning: Formatting the easy way</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Those of you who who are sick of having to alter a set of numbers and tinker with html or CSS every time you need to position a picture or div tag will enjoy absolute positioning. When used in conjunction with Dreamweaver, a div tag that is positioned absolutely can literally be dragged around and it will stay put!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The main caveat with absolute positioning is that the div tag is always relative to ‘something’ and, by default, are relative to the upper left corner of your browser’s window.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Remember a few steps back when you were asked to use relative positioning for CSS rules such as right_side_content? When you apply absolute positioning to a div tag inside of another div tag that does NOT have either relative or absolute positioning strange things happen. The position of the new div tag with absolute positioning becomes relative to the nearest ancestor with either relative or absolute positioning; usually the upper left hand corner of the browser window. Suddenly the picture that seemed to be perfectly positioned when you inserted dragged it to just the location where you wanted it, stays put while the div tags that contain all of your content leave it behind. This concept is a bit hard to understand at first but the bottom line is ALWAYS make sure that the parent div tag has relative (usually) or absolute positioning before you stick a new div tag inside of it with absolute positioning . Whew!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If none of this makes sense yet, hopefully it will become clearer as you proceed through the next few steps. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Open waterfall.html.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-068.jpeg" alt="images/pict-068.jpeg"></span><span class="s1">Now create a new id rule called #absolute_example. Click the positioning tab and set the width and height to 300, Z-index to 1, and position to absolute as shown at right. Click OK.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Click inside of the rightside_content div tag -look at the code to be sure that you are actually in there- and insert a new div tag. Attach the absolute_example style to the new div tag.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">A new div tag should appear on your screen as shown at </span><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-069.jpeg" alt="images/pict-069.jpeg"></span><span class="s1">right. Unlike the previous dig tags that you created, this one has a little handle at the top left corner. Grab that handle and move it somewhere else.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Now click on the div tag to select it and move your cursor to one of the other three corners. At some point a small line with two arrows should appear. When it does, hold down your mouse button and resize the div tag. </span><span class="s3"><img src="images/pict-070.jpeg" alt="images/pict-070.jpeg"></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Now return to the CSS editor and click on absolute_example. If necessary, resize the bottom of the CSS styles window so that you can see the properties of absolute_example. Note the the width and height properties have changed and two additional properties that you didn’t create, left and top, have also appeared. Left and Top are the absolute positioning properties that determine the placement of absolute_content inside of its “parent” tag (which in this case is rightside_content.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Move the div tag around and resize it some more. As you do so, watch what happens to the numbers that express its properties. That’s right, the CSS is re-written on the fly as you manipulate the div tab with your mouse!</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Insert a waterfall picture into the div tag. Re-size the div tag so that the waterfall picture fits comfortably and add some descriptive text above the picture. Now move the picture wherever you want it to go.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">You thought that was easy? Try this shortcut: once again, making sure that you are inside of the rightside_content div tag, go to your insert menu, move your mouse to layout objects and insert an AP Div. At this point you should see another yellow box like the last one. That’s right, when you insert an AP Div you automatically create an absolutely positioned div tag with its very CSS id.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Insert another waterfall picture into this div tag. Create 2 more ap div tags and insert pictures into them as well. Drag everything around until you like the positioning. You can even overlap pictures and create some kind of collage! <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">By the way did you notice that some pictures are always on top of other pictures. That’s because their div tag is tied to a CSS rule with a higher z-index value. The z-index value controls what, for lack of a better term, we will call the ‘layer value’. Chances are, the #absolute_example id that you created first has the very lowest value. Just for fun, drag another picture so that it hides the picture inside of #absolute_example. Now take a look inside of the div_layout.css file, find #absolute_example and change it’s z-index value to something big such as 20.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At this point it should ‘rise to the top’ so to speak.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Starting with waterfall.html, create links inside of the leftlinks div tag to the monkeys.html, birds_and_bananas.html, and (yes, I’m serious) to waterfall.html. Save waterfall.html and test the links. If they work properly, copy the links from waterfall.html and past them into the same div tag in birds_and_bananas.html and and monkeys.html. Save everything and test. At this point you should have a fully functional website. Each html file should have links to itself and to the other two files.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Test thoroughly. If the links are not working properly, ask for help.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">If you are feeling ambitious and still have time, add “thumb_pictures” to your navigation (such as thumb_munkee.jpg)</span></li>
